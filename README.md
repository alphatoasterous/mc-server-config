# Basic configuration for [Purpur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/) 1.17.1 instance
These are configuration files for my *possible* Minecraft server. Don't know if someone is actually interested in it, though.

Additional tweaking is made following these tutorials:
* [Minecraft server optimization guide by YouHaveTrouble](https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization)
* [Recommended Paper Anti-Xray settings by stonar96](https://gist.github.com/stonar96/ba18568bd91e5afd590e8038d14e245e)

## Todo
* Startup script
* Reasonable Anti-Xray settings (DIY for the time being)
* Configurations for popular plugins
